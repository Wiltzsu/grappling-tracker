# Grappling Tracker

Grappling Tracker is a web-based application tailored for martial arts enthusiasts to track and analyze their training sessions, techniques, and progress over time. It provides a user-friendly dashboard for logging training details, viewing statistics, and managing one's martial arts journey effectively. It's a long-time project for myself that emerged from my own need
of keeping track of my training. It's a work in progress and I'm constantly adding new features and improvements.
